Synopsis
----------------------
This is a pipline of method for junction splice QTL (jsQTL) analysis. 
The method is desiged to identify junction-skipping events from the RNA-seq data from GTEx and their regulatory variants.
Method details available at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/804039v1

----------------------
Prerequisites
----------------------
Linux system is required for this analysis pipline.
e.g.: Ubuntu 16.04

Softwares or packages required:
  python >= 2.7.9
  python package:
    HTSeq >= 0.7.2
    numpy 1.14.3
    pandas >=0.18.1
    matplotlib 2.0.2
  plink 1.9


----------------------
Usage
----------------------
The small demo data are: 
  junct_bed/*.bed : individual junction reads data in bed format generated using "junction extract" in regtools (ttps://regtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  toy.bed toy.bim toy.fam : genotype data generated using the --make-bed option in PLINK (HTTP://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/). 
  toy.geno : Customizing genotype data format including:
   CHROM:chromosome,	POS:postion,	ID:snp id,	REF: reference allele,	ALT: alternative allele,	QUAL: quality same as VCF, 
   FILTER: filter type,	INFO:information,	EXP_FREQ_A1:reference allele frequency,   MISS: missing, 
   SampleID1, SampleID2, ..., SampleIDn".  
  

The python scripts for analysis are in the py folder:
  py/*.py

The result of demo are in "result/" folder:
  result/

The detail analysis steps are all in the "pipline_run.sh" file.


jsQTL analysis can be performed by calling sh pipline_run.sh in bash. 
jsQTL analysis test result are in "chrAll_SK_np_mw/" folder. The test p-value result are in "*.geno_gp_p.txt" files.
jsQTL Fine-mapping result are in "tissue1_asj_chrAll_p0.01_n0.05_r2/" folder. The Fine-mapping post-probability result are in "*_geno_gp_p_sorted_uniq_np_top95.txt"
